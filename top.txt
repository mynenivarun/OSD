top command is used to show the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the 
running system. Usually, this command shows the summary information of the system and the
list of processes or threads which
are currently managed by the Linux Kernel.

As soon as you will run this command it will open an interactive command mode where the top
half portion will 
contain the statistics of processes and resource usage. And Lower half contains a list of the 
currently running processes. Pressing q will simply exit the command mode.
