We successfully created a basic XV6 shell with what our team believes to 
be necessary for a common usage. We learnt a lot from working with a 
basic Operating System and would like to thank everyone for this 
opportunity. The journey to modifying the XV6 and implementing ourown 
shell was a very interesting and eventful one and even though sometimes, 
our code was like a shot in the dark, we believe that we achieved what we 
wanted to in the end
